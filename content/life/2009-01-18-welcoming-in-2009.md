<!-- title: Welcoming in 2009 -->
One of the resolutions this year was to post more on my blog and as it's already 18th of January before the first post of 2009 I may be behind schedule...

One of the delays has been just not feeling comfortable with the look of my blog and the ever present Damocles sword of updating the blog software. I use wordpress and seem to be updating the software more often than updating the blog. Hopefully since I have taken the hour this morning to carefully backup the old site, check my config file changes and install a stable version of 2.7 this will no longer be an issue - at least until 2.8 comes out.

I've also treated myself to a new theme, I'm not sure about the blue but the basic style layout is ideal. As I hope to write on a number of varied subjects that interest me, I'm not going to be happy with an overtly geeky or typewriter or photography style - especially if I'm advocating the best use of chilli in parsnip soup at the time.

So the plan is - and I'm telling all of you so I don't back out - to write more on my journey into php, my latest love hate relationship with html5, my favourite organic veg inspired recipe of the moment, the tai chi move I can't get my head around and maybe my latest photography walk with highlights.

It's a tall order perhaps and I may not succeed with everything all of the time but if I learnt only one thing in 2008 it was that if you don't **aim** for the stars, you sure as hell ain't gonna get there.
