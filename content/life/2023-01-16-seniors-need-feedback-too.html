<!-- title: Seniors need feedback too -->
<p>If you ever ask yourself at work, "should I give this person feedback" the answer is always yes. What and how you deliver it is between you and that person. Hopefully you work in a company that openly values feedback and I do recommend Kim Scott's <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com">Radical Candor</a> as a good read to help you be clear around perspective and intent, but I maintain that the answer to "should I?" is yes.</p>

<p>This week I was involved in a meeting that scared me in its intensity, I believed I was not a warrior type or strong advocate. Still, I was myself and asked the questions I needed to for my situation and my reports. Afterwards I received some clear, specific (and positive) feedback on the impact I've made on other folks, even those I don't normally directly interact with. I was honoured that they took the time, especially as being a senior I apparently appear like "I've got this nailed". On the inside, I sometimes don't feel like I've nailed anything much.</p>

<p>This new data has helped me switch and centre my internal world view. Knowing that others value what I do is massively heartening and knowing exactly what it was that helped, allows me to focus on improving that too.</p>

<p>So, receiving feedback is for everyone, not just those at the start of their career. Giving feedback is for everyone, not just those in leading roles. We're all travellers on a journey, let's keep talking along the way.</p>
