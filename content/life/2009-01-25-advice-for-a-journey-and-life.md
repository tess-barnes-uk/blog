<!-- title: Advice for a journey and life -->
A young friend is off on a long journey soon and as I wondered how best to wish him well I came up with the following. Of course me being me and being my age I couldn't resist a fair chunk of (probably unwanted!) advice...

I just wanted to say good luck on your journey to new lands, I hope you find what you're looking for there. Since I have a huge dollop of zen in my philosophy, the way I looked when I was searching was to look for koans, short phrases containing nuggets of truth. You find one that enflames the senses and opens the soul and you live by it for a while until it no longer needs to mean anything, then you find the next, kinda like signposts on the path to life. You find them in the moments you listen to. Hope that helps... and when all else fails, have fun :)

I guess it's not a bad view of life for anyone.
