# On my bookshelf

This is an ongoing and growing list of references for my many hobbies. It contains unashamedly both adult and childrens references. In my view, just because a book is aimed at children does not exclude its value as a good basic guide; they often have clearer identification illustrations or instructions.

**Nature Field Guides**

*Larousse Pocket Guide :Trees of Britain and Europe* by David Sutton

*Pocket Guide Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe* by Fitter, Fitter & Blamey
Published: HarperCollins

Except I need a new copy, my old one appears to have gone AWOL

Usborne Pocketbook Spotter's Guides:-
- *Wild Flowers* by Christopher Humphries, beautiful clear illustrations by Hilary Burn

- *Garden Flowers* by Barry Ambrose, illustrated by William Giles

- *Animal Tracks and Signs* by Alfred Leutscher, illustrated by Chris Shields

Hamlyn Tracker Guide:
*Wild Flowers* by Bob Gibbons - easy reference and habitat descriptions

**Nature Reference**

*Popular Field Botany:A familiar and technical description of the plants most common to the various localities of the British Isles* by Agnes Catlow
Published: Reeve & Co, Covent Garden, London, 1852

Lovingly restored by <a href="https://hareguizer.insanejournal.com">Kristi</a>

*Culpepers Complete Herbal: Profusely Illustrated in Colour*
Foulsham edition

*Nature Watchers Directory* by David Marsden
Published: Treasure Press (1989 edition)

Great sections on Habitat and Split by geographical areas of the UK to give plenty of ideas of where to go and what you may be lucky enough to see.
I won this book as a prize in school.  The plate states 'British Hedgehog Preservation Society Prize'. Sadly I can no longer remember what it was I did to win it but it is now a favourite reference.

*The Amateur Naturalist* by Gerald Durrell
Book Club Associates edition
Dorling Kindersley Ltd 1982

I remember my parents buying this and a magazine series on country life to help support me in my passion for wildlife. It's something we still share.

*Complete British Wildlife Photoguide* by Paul Sterry
Published: HarperCollins 1997

Free with RNIB membership. What this book lacks in clear identification photos it makes up in its comprehensive coverage of all types of flora and fauna. It also has an excellent glossary just in case you need to check what Elytra are (the hardened forewings of a beetle).

**Cooking & Winemaking**
*The Complete Book of Self Sufficiency* by John Seymour
Published Faber 1976/77 (1981 reprint)

Great for my favourite kinds of recipes - throw it all in and see what happens

*Country Wisdom* by Rosamond Richardson
Published Kyle Cathie Ltd, 1997

Highlights include the wild food calendar, rosemary hair care and my favourite jam recipe - Lemon and Rhubarb

*Food from your Garden* - a Readers Digest publication 1977

Like the Self Sufficiency book, this came from my parents (I have custody anyway!) and it's still full of amazing titbits. Great preserves and wine recipes including my favourites for pear & ginger chutney and elderberry port. Also the best step by step instructions I've ever found for country wine making.

**Writing**

*Heinemann English Dictionary*

Just to check any glaring errors in posts (typos are different and accidental) as memory fails the best of us occasionally. Still using the old battered copy I got for senior school at age 11, if it was good enough for my exacting english teacher it is good enough for me.
