<!-- title: Light: a many faceted prompt -->

<p>One of the prompts from the weekly photo challenge I am following this year was "Light". It's the first one where I couldn't simply be happy to take one shot; my mind raced with a multitude of possibilities. Even putting aside "carefree" and "lightweight" (falling blossoms are beyond my photographic skills right now), there are so many favourites to choose from as light can mean so much...</p>

<p>Light can bring out a shine</p>

<p>though refraction shows we cannot trust everything we see, especially when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic_(optics)">caustic</a></p>

<p>Light can bring translucence to hint at delicacy</p>

<p>and also make the translucent appear opaque</p>
