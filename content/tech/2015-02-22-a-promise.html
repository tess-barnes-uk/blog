<!-- title: A Promise -->
<p>There were some very inspiring keynotes and talks at <a href="http://phpconference.co.uk/about/">php uk 2015</a> which lead me to catch up with many of the speakers. I've been a member of the php community since <a title="Confessions of a conference virgin!" href="/blog/tech/confessions-of-a-conference-virgin/">2008</a> although my involvement has been very on and off. I've a few years worth of experience since then and it's certainly time I gave something back; so I have made a promise, to Jenny (@miss_jwo), to the php uk community and to you - in the next year I will give <em>at least one public talk.</em></p>

<p>I have too many ideas to know what the topic will be but:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it will be tech related,</li>
	<li>it will most likely involve php,</li>
	<li>it will possibly be rubbish but</li>
	<li>it <strong>will</strong> be given.</li>
</ul>
<p>More news to follow...</p>
