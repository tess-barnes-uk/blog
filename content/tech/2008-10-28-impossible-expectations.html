<!-- title: Impossible expectations? -->
<p>Although I'm self employed I keep my eye on the job market and this morning came across this corker:</p>

<blockquote>Ideally the successful candidate will be a 6th form leaver or graduate who has excellent knowledge/experience of Photoshop, CSS and XHTML but more importantly must be able to demonstrate a portfolio of work for a number of clients.</blockquote>

<p>Do sixth form students regularly work with clients these days? Or am I missing something?</p>
