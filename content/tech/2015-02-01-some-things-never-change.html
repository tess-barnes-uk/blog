<!-- title: Some things never change -->
<p>The lessons here are ones I've taken a while to learn and they are relevant to coding and most things in life and they have not changed in the six years since I first posted them!</p>

<p>I hope this blog post helps others learn them quicker:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Conclusions drawn, even by the 'wise men' in a community should never be taken on their own, as gospel.</li>
	<li>Always check the date of a resource if you can.(most of the posts on here are several years old!)</li>
	<li>Do your own tests.</li>
	<li>Join in discussions and check your view against that of others.</li>
	<li>Go back and review your own conclusions after time, has anything changed? new techniques or technology been released? did you jump the gun?</li>
	<li>Never be afraid to admit you would change your mind (even if it's only to yourself).</li>
	<li>Never be afraid to try something new.</li>
</ul>
