<!-- title: Keeping my promise -->
<p>This was very nearly about breaking my promise, in fact I had drafted a blog post full of excuses as to how my year had been miserable and there was no way I could fulfil my <a title="A Promise" href="http://tessbarnes.uk/blog/uncategorized/a-promise/">promise of February</a>. Then I panicked, ditched the post and emailed the wonderful and supportive Jenny (@miss_jwo) confessing my failure.</p>

<p>A little while later something wonderful happened, I spotted an opportunity and careless of the consequences, grabbed it with both hands. I surprised myself. A few emails later and <a href="http://phpsw.uk">phpsw user group</a> had kindly accepted my proposal to give a lightening talk. The talk was last Wednesday night. Their warm welcome was a real testament to the friendly community that is a php user group. I am happy to report I felt calmer than I have ever felt in front of 40+ strangers and I am looking forward to doing it again. So much so in fact, I am considering submitting to other user group nights and even conferences!</p>

<p>Along the way I have learned a few great things about speaking:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it's really easy to arrange</li>
	<li>it doesn't have to be a new idea, just your take on it</li>
	<li>audiences come up with the coolest questions (and tips!) to make you think</li>
	<li>turning up early wins you brownie points and more free drinks choices</li>
	<li>practicing your talk to yourself in a spare office the week before is worth it just for the funny looks you get</li>
	<li>lots of user groups are looking for new speakers of any experience level</li>
	<li>you might even get your petrol money back</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all I got to keep a promise and that's worth everything.</p>
