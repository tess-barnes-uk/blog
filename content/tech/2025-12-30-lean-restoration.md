<!-- title: A lean restoration -->
<!-- render: yes -->
As I get older I get lazier which means writing leaner code. I get frustrated with large fragmented and overbearing code bases. Wordpress is good for many things but it's seriously overengineered for just showing a few words on the screen, even with colour coded syntax.

Yes I could host a blog on one of the many services: medium, substack or other things I'm too uncool to have ever heard of. But then, services are owned by other people. Some of whom I don't like.

So call it what you will: a dusty corner of the internet from the time of web rings; a therapeutic journaling exercise; an egotistical plea for legacy or honestly: just somewhere to note some things I found useful so I don't forget.

Here's to forgetting fewer things in the next year.
